# Elderly Care AI Companion

The **Elderly Care AI Companion** is a Node.js-based backend API designed to help caregivers monitor the health of elderly individuals in real time. The system collects vital signs such as pulse and blood pressure from wearable devices and sends instant alerts to caregivers through WhatsApp when these health metrics fall outside normal ranges. This ensures that caregivers can respond promptly to any potential health emergencies.

## Features

- **Caregiver Registration**: Caregivers can register their contact information to receive alerts.
- **Real-time Health Monitoring**: Vital signs (pulse and blood pressure) are collected from wearables and processed by the backend.
- **Automated Alerts**: Twilio’s WhatsApp API is integrated to send real-time alerts to caregivers when abnormal health data is detected.
- **Node.js & Express**: A robust and scalable backend built using Node.js and Express.js.
- **SQLite Database**: Lightweight data storage solution for user and health information.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12.0 or higher)
- [Twilio Account](https://www.twilio.com/) with WhatsApp Business API credentials
- SQLite (comes pre-installed with Node.js SQLite3 package)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/elderly-care-backend.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd elderly-care-backend
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Set up your environment variables for Twilio in a `.env` file:

```bash
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM=whatsapp:+14155238886
```

5. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

### 1. **Register a Caregiver**

**Endpoint**: `POST /register`  
Registers a new caregiver to receive health notifications.

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone": "+1234567890"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "caregiverId": 1
}
```

### 2. **Submit Health Data**

**Endpoint**: `POST /health-data`  
Submit health data from wearables for monitoring and trigger alerts if necessary.

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "caregiverId": 1,
  "pulse": 55,
  "bloodPressure": 85
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Health data recorded"
}
```

If the pulse or blood pressure exceeds predefined limits, a WhatsApp alert will be sent to the caregiver’s registered phone number.

## Challenges & Future Work

- **Frontend Development**: Currently, the project only has a backend system. A frontend interface (web or mobile) will be developed to allow caregivers to interact with the system more easily.
- **AI Integration**: Future plans include using AI for predictive analytics to detect potential health issues before they occur.
- **Scalability**: As the system grows, cloud services like AWS or Azure may be employed to scale efficiently.
